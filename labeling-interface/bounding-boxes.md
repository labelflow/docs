# Bounding boxes

A bounding box is the simplest type of label that is defined by just two points.

These are the simple steps you need to take to make a bounding box label:

1. Select the bounding box tool on the left
2. Click on the outermost edge of the subject of the label
3. Click the opposite edge of the object to create a rectangle covering the subject

You can move and resize the bounding box to make changes after it is created

* Select and drag a vertex to its correct position
* Click anywhere in the label to drag it to the correct position
