# Import from Computer

Use this import method when you want to import images and labels from your local computer.&#x20;

## Import images only

These are the simple steps you should follow to import from your computer:

1. Press the **Add images** button on the top right
2. Drag and drop your images and/or folders.
3. Select **Start Labeling **once the import is finished

It's that easy. 🔥👌

Images are not uploaded to LabelFlow servers so you are in control of your data.

## Import Images and Labels

LabelFlow can ingest Images and Labels into a dataset. For that you must drop a zip file containing the images and the labels in COCO format.

* Open an existing dataset or create a new one
* Press the **Add images** button on the top right
* Drag and drop your zip file containing the images and labels in the COCO format.
* Select **Start Labeling **once the import is finished

It's that easy. 🔥👌
