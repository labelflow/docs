Simply enter your teammates' email addresses to add them to the workspace.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
* Users invited to a workspace have access to all of its datasets, so be mindful of who you invite
* Don't hesitate to create multiple workspaces for different teams and projects
{% endhint %}

One email address per line when inviting new members
{% endhint %}

For now, all invitees are given the _**Owner** _ role, giving them the ability to edit & delete datasets as well as update the plan, payment methods and billing information. More roles will be added in the near future.&#x20;

Head over to [our feedback page](https://labelflow.canny.io) to let us know what roles you'd like to see on LabelFlow, and vote on other new features.
