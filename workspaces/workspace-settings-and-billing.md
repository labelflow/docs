# 💸 Workspace Settings & Billing

The settings tab is where you'll be able to update your workspace's name, your plan and also delete your workspace.

### Name & Avatar

You can change the name of your workspace from the settings tab. Making modifications to the name will also automatically update the Avatar, which helps to quickly identify specific workspaces.

You'll also be able to consult and update your current plan, payment methods and billing information from the settings tab to match your needs.&#x20;

### Delete Workspace

This is what we call the _Danger Zone_. You can delete a workspace along with all of its data from the settings tab. In order to delete the workspace for good, you will be prompted to type the workspace's name to avoid any potential accidents.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
* Deleting the **Workspace** workspace will delete all of its images and labels
