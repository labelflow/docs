# Import from Computer

You should use the second import method when you want to import images from your local computer. 

These are the simple steps you should follow to import from your computer:

1. Press the **Add images** button on the top right
2. Drag and drop your images and/or folders.
3. Select **Start Labelling** once the import is finished

It's that easy. 🔥👌
